# Coffee Shop App
A simple coffee shop console app written in Java, with Maven, backed by a Postgres database hosted on AWS using JDBC that also utilizes JUnit testing and SLF4J logging.

# What I learned
* Java: Using Mavan to create a java console app and how dependencies work. 
* Postgres: How to have persistant data using a database hosted on AWS.
* AWS: How to create a database using AWS RDS and connect it to my console app using JDBC.
* JUnit: How to create unit tests using Mockito for my console application.
* SLF4J: How to log for my console application.

# What I can improve on
* JUnit: Use Mockito better and better unit tests.
* SLF4J: Use better logging for transactions.
